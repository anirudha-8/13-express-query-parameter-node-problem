# 🌟 Problem 13: Express Route with Query Parameters 🌟  

Welcome to the thirteenth challenge in the Node.js practical problem series! 🚀 In this challenge, you'll work with **Express.js** to handle query parameters dynamically. Let's dive in! 💻  

---

## 📝 Problem Statement  

Create an **Express.js route** that:  

1. Accepts a query parameter `name`.  

2. Responds with the message: **"Hello, [name]!"** if the `name` query parameter is provided.  

3. Sends a default response if `name` is not provided.  

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals  

- Learn how to handle **query parameters** in Express.js.  

- Explore conditional responses based on the presence of query parameters.  

- Familiarize yourself with sending dynamic responses in Express.js.  

---

## 📂 Project Structure  

Your project folder should look like this:  

```bash  
13-express-query-parameter-node-problem/  
├── server.js           # The Express server script  
├── README.md           # Documentation for this problem  
└── package.json        # Project configuration file  
```

---

## 🌟 Features to Enhance

Once you've implemented the basic functionality, try adding:

- **Validation**: Ensure the name query parameter contains valid characters.

- **Multiple Parameters**: Extend the route to accept additional query parameters, like age or city.

- **Middleware**: Use middleware to check if required query parameters are present.

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

- Handling query parameters in Express.js using req.query.

- Writing conditional logic for dynamic responses.

- Building flexible and interactive routes in Express.js.
